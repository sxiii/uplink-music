# uplink-music
Music from Uplink and Bonus CD in source S3M, MOD and XM formats.

Introversion removed Uplink Bonus CD link (actually, they just re-made the website).

So to let the great Uplink OST live, I am uploading it here.

This repo contains both used and unused music from Uplink.

## How to play the files
To play tracks, you will need a tracker that supports S3M, MOD and XM formats.

Good and my favourite choice is Milkytracker, but you can consider also using:
* Psycle
* Neil
* SchismTracker
* Prototracker
* Klystrack
* GoatTracker
* FastTracker clone
